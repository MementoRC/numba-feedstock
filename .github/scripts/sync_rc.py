"""Sync conda-forge:main into the rc branch while preserving rc identity.

Companion to bump_rc.py. Where bump_rc.py tracks new prereleases on PyPI and
bumps rc's version, this keeps rc's *framework* -- build script, pins, CI
scaffolding -- in step with conda-forge's main branch, while preserving the
handful of fields that make rc the rc branch.

Two subcommands, driven by .github/workflows/rc-sync.yml:

  capture   Read rc's recipe.yaml BEFORE the merge and record identity fields
            (version, sha256, build_number) plus any --preserve blocks
            (default source.patches) to a JSON file.

            Blocks matter because recipe.yaml is resolved per-hunk "theirs":
            rc-only content such as its patches list lives INSIDE those hunks
            and would otherwise be silently reverted to main's on every sync.
  resolve   After `git merge --no-commit upstream/main` has left conflicts,
            resolve the known-safe set and report anything else as unresolved.

Resolution table:

  <recipe>                        theirs, then re-inject captured identity
  --theirs paths (default         theirs, PER HUNK. README.md is regenerated
  README.md,conda-forge.yml)      by a rerender anyway; conda-forge.yml is a
                                  rerender INPUT, so it must be merged rather
                                  than taken whole-file.
  --regenerated globs             theirs, WHOLE FILE (conda-smithy output;
                                  the rerender overwrites it immediately)
  --ours paths (default           ours   (channel_targets: conda-forge
  recipe/conda_build_config.yaml) llvmlite_rc is rc's entire purpose)
  anything else                   left conflicted and reported

Conflicts are resolved PER HUNK, not per file. `git checkout --theirs <path>`
would take their whole file and silently discard hunks that auto-merged
cleanly -- which would drop rc-only recipe fixes. Content outside conflict
markers is preserved verbatim.
